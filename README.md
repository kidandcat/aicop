# aicop — AI Coding Capabilities

This project evaluates Claude's ability to write complex, optimized programs across a spectrum of programming languages — from high-level (Ruby, Python) down to low-level (C, Assembly).

## Goals

- Measure code correctness, performance, and idiomatic quality across languages.
- Test problem-solving on tasks that demand algorithmic efficiency and hardware-aware optimization.
- Compare outputs at different abstraction levels for the same problem.

## Language Spectrum

| Level | Languages |
|-------|-----------|
| High  | Ruby, Python, TypeScript |
| Mid   | Go, Rust, C |
| Low   | x86-64 Assembly, ARM64 Assembly |
